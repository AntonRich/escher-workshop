# Escher-in-Elm Workshop

Welcome to the Escher-in-Elm Workshop!

This workshop is based on the classic 1982 paper "Functional Geometry" by Peter Henderson. The paper shows the functional decomposition and reconstruction of Escher's woodcutting "Square Limit", a beautiful recursive tesselation of interleaving fish. In this workshop, we will follow in Henderson's footsteps as we create an SVG replica of it.

This workshop uses Elm as the implementation language, but it is not an Elm tutorial. If you feel need a proper Elm tutorial before attempting this workshop, take a look at [Awesome Elm](https://github.com/isRuslan/awesome-elm) to find one that suits you.

If all you need is a syntax cheat-sheet, you can take a look here.

The focus in this workshop is on abstraction and composition. It happens to use Elm because we will be producing an SVG, and the browser is a nice runtime for that.

## Getting started

## Exercises

We will start by defining a number of simple picture transformations; functions of type Picture -> Picture.

### Exercise 1 : turn

Define a function _turn_, which rotates a picture 90 degrees counter-clockwise around the center of its bounding box.

You should observe that turning a picture twice rotates it 180 degrees, and turning it four times produces the original picture.

### Exercise 2 : flip

Define a function _flip_, which flips a picture about the center vertical axis of its bounding box.

Note that flipping a picture twice (indeed any even number of times) produces the original picture.

### Exercise 3 : toss

Define a function _toss_, which resembles tossing a picture light-heartedly into the air! More precisely, it should rotate the picture 45 degrees around top left corner of the bounding box, and also shrinks the sides of the bounding box by a factor of âˆš2.

### Exercise 4 : above

Now we'll start combining pictures to create more complex, composite pictures.

Define a function _above_, which takes two pictures _p1_ and _p2_ as parameters. It should produce a new picture which fills the upper half of the bounding box with _p1_ and the lower half with _p2_.

Define a more general function _aboveRatio_ that takes integers _n_ and _m_ as parameters, as well as _p1_ and _p2_ as above. The integers _n_ and _m_ are weights allocated to _p1_ and _p2_ respectively. 

Now implement _above_ in terms of _aboveRatio_.

### Exercise 5 : beside

Define a function _besideRatio_, which is similar to _aboveRatio_. However, rather than placing _p1_ on top of _p2_, it should place _p1_ to the left of _p2_. 

Define _beside_ in terms of _besideRatio_.

### Exercise 6 : quartet

Using _above_ and _beside_, define a function _quartet_ which takes four pictures _nw_, _ne_, _sw_ and _se_ as inputs. The names of the pictures hint at how they should be organized.

### Exercise 7 : nonet

### Exercise 8 : over

### Exercise 9 : t-tile

### Exercise 10 : u-tile

### Exercise 11 : side

### Exercise 12 : corner

### Exercise 13 : square-limit
